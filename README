Program pman (Process Manager) is able to run basic shell commands: ls, cd, exit. As well as create a process (and run it in background), present a list of process and terminate/stop/start a process.

How to use pman:
	Step 1:	compile test files that you want to use
	Step 2: execute "make" in terminal to compile pman
	Step 3: execute "./pman" in terminal to run pman
	Step 4: input supported commands in pman

Supported Commands of pman:
	1. bg <cmd>:		Start a program <cmd> inm the background
	2. bglist:		Display a list of all the programs currently executing in the background
	3. bgkill <pid>:	Terminate the process <pid>
	4. bgstop <pid>:	Temporarily stop process <pid>
	5. bgstart <pid>:	Restart process <pid> which has been previously stopped
    6. pstat <pid>:     Print information related to <pid>
	
Important notes for bg:
	If you want to run inf.c using bg, compile inf.c using "gcc inf.c -o inf" or execute "make inf" before you execute "./pman".
Compile and run pman and input "bg ./inf a 1" where "a" and 1 are the parameters required by inf.c Note that you should use ./inf if inf is not in PATH.
